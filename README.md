My first repository, created following GitHub Docs Get Started guides. So far, I've covered 'Hello World' "Create a Repo' and 'Fork a Repo'

## notes
| **GitHub term** | **Definition** | **Shorthand** |
| --- | -------- | ------- |
| *Repository* | folder that contains and organizes a chronological list of file(type)s relevant to a project. This folder is hosted by GitHub, and these relevant files are often uploaded to GitHub by the user | repo |
| *README file* | a .md filetype that can be added to any repo in the creation window. This file explains the scope and scale of the repo, project, and any other useful information I wish to include | README |
| *Branch* | a workspace made of a copy of the `main` repository. This workspace allows the user to tinker and save changes in the project files without actually merging these changes until the user or repo owner decides to. | branching, branches |
| *Commits* | saved changes. importantly: these changes are complete, and isolated. This makes it easy to reverse them if need be without changing other parts of the project | --- |
| *Commit message* | description attached to every commit which says what change was made and why. usually starts with double hashtags because R | --- |
| *Pull request* | request sent from a branch workspace to the repo collaborators to review and add to `main` the changes made in the branch workspace. | pull |
| *Merge* | incorporating the changes from the branch into the `main` repo by approving the pull request. | merging |
| *Fork* | a copy of the entire repository. Forking differs from branching in the way the repos are used. Branching is usually for collaborators within a project; forking is for copying the project for external use (especially in the case of open source projects). | forking |
